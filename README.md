# Welcome to Bartender

Welcome to **Bartender**. Would you like your tracks **shaken**, not **stirred**?

## What Bartender Does
Bartender uses Spotify audio features to organise and transition songs in creative ways:

- **Stirred Mode**: Plays songs in clusters of similar tracks, inserting smooth midpoint transitions between clusters for a more cohesive flow.
- **Shaken Mode**: Chooses the most contrasting songs from the playlist to create energetic, unpredictable jumps between tracks.
- **Playlist Creation**: Generates new playlists based on the selected transition mode.
